# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how the WhereIsThisPlace application ("the App") handles user data. We respect your privacy and aim to collect as little personal information as possible.

## Photo Deletion
- Photos uploaded for geolocation are stored only in memory during processing.
- All uploaded photos are automatically deleted within **60 seconds** after processing is complete.

## Optional LLM Feature
- The App includes an optional large language model (LLM) feature that can suggest descriptions or landmarks based on your photo.
- The LLM feature is **disabled by default**. Users must opt in before any data is sent to an LLM service.

## Data Retention
- We may store anonymized prediction metadata (latitude, longitude, score, and bias warnings) for debugging and quality improvement.
- We do not store your photos or personal information beyond the short processing period mentioned above.

## Analytics
- We may collect anonymous usage statistics to improve the App. No personally identifiable information is logged.

## Contact
For questions about this Privacy Policy, please open an issue in the repository or contact the developers at `whereisthisplace@example.com`.
